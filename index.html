		<p>Recent data provided by the New York State Department of Labor reveals an interesting trend in construction-related fatal incidents in New York State. The data was collected by the Department of Labor (DOL), New York Lab L, Section 44. </br> </br> The DOL recorded 27 total construction-related incidents that resulted in a fatal injury since 2022. Seven construction workers who died were members of a union. Twenty of the construction workers who suffered a fatal injury were not.</br> </br>

</script> </br>Of the seven listed locations across the state, over half of those fatal injuries occurred in New York City. In total, there were 20 incidents resulting in death in the city. There are several construction industries recorded in the dataset including building components, building construction, masonry, renovation, welding and “other.” Seventeen of the 27 fatal injuries occurred at a building construction site. </br></br> According to the New York Engineers, "Falls, being struck by an object, electrocution, or being caught in between equipment, are the four most common causes of accidental deaths and other injuries. Having a culture of safety reduces the risk of these types of accidents."</br></br>In conclusion, the dataset provided by the New York State Department of Labor raises several concerns about the safety of construction sites. More specifically, the level of safety measures being taken on construction sites that are largely employed with non-union employees.
