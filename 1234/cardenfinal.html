                <span class="hugeLetter">T</span>he citizens of New York State have experienced dangerous, hazy air quality since March of this year. Concentrated plumes of Canadian Wildfire smoke have drifted into the atmosphere, covering several regions of the United States as a result of climate change.
            </br></br>
                Many people avoid climate change discourse because the topic is too overwhelming and abstract. For some, the trends of climate change are easy to ignore because the region they reside in is not directly impacted. For people across Central New York, the extreme weather has become impossible to ignore. </br> </br>

                With two months remaining in the wildfire season, 2023 is already the most destructive  season on record for Canada. The month of July broke records across the globe as the hottest July ever recorded. While this year has exhibited cruel summer temperatures and prolonged droughts, the trends of extreme weather are not new. Wildfires, for example, are the result of extreme hot and dry conditions—directly linked to climate change and global warming.

            </br></br>
                The United Nations defines <a href="https://www.un.org/en/climatechange/what-is-climate-change"target="blank"> climate change </a> as, “long-term shifts in temperatures and weather patterns, mainly caused by human activities, especially the burning of fossil fuels.” Greenhouse gases caused by the burning of fossil fuels wrap around the earth, trapping heat and causing temperatures to soar. Common greenhouse gases burned in human processes include carbon dioxide and methane. 
            </br></br>
                Large wildfires can have a significant impact on the quality of air in the atmosphere. 
                Last year, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1RPm-2rr-b7CFbLlLPl4TuBtSRueLN37ETExgJQqe-6g/edit?usp=sharing"target="blank"> reported  
                </a>199 days with moderate air quality and eight days with unhealthy air quality in New 
                York state. </br></br>
                The air quality index (AQI) is a standardized measurement of air pollution and associated health risks in a specific area. There are six levels of AQI, ranging from good to hazardous: </br> </br>

                0-50 is considered good air quality. There are no 
                health risks. 51-100 is moderate and considered acceptable. There is little chance of health risk for sensitive populations. 101-150 is considered unhealthy for sensitive groups. Doctors begin advising against strenuous activity outdoors regardless of health condition. 150-200 is considered unhealthy to both sensitive groups and members of the general public. 200-300 is considered very unhealthy. The risk of health effects is increased for everyone. Any AQI above 300 is considered hazardous with emergency health risks.

                This year, the trend of high temperatures and poor air quality has               continued. Throughout the spring and summer months, the citizens of Syracuse, New York have encountered poor air quality and hazy sunsets as wildfire plumes travel west from Canada.

                tracked</a> daily air quality in New York from July 9 through August 9.

                 Poor air quality affects sensitive groups including older populations, young children and infants, people who work outdoors and people with lung conditions such as asthma and pulmonary disease.

                According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), wildfire smoke can make <em>anyone                 
                </em> sick. Wildfire smoke is dangerous because the omitted fumes carry a mix of gasses and tiny, harmful fragments of debris particles. <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/disasters/wildfires/smoke.html"target="blank"> Health affects</a> of breathing in smoke include coughing, trouble breathing, eye burning, throat irritation, headaches, shortness of breath and chest pain.
            </br> </br>
                Syracuse resident Irvin Daniels, 72, does not have any pre-existing
                health conditions. Regardless, he takes precautions on the hazy days. When the AQI is high, Daniels wears a face covering. "I take the necessary precautions to avoid the smoke," he explained.

                       According to Canada’s Department of Natural Resources, several factors related to climate change can increase the risk of wildfires. High temperatures 
                        and dry climate foster the perfect environment for wildfires like those currently burning millions of acres of forests in Canada. </br></br>

                Addressing climate change is a complex task. But experts believe the extreme weather will only get <em>more extreme</em> if we ignore it. The continued progression of climate change due to human activity will continue to cause severe weather events, posing health challenges for local communities here in New York State and across the world. </br>
