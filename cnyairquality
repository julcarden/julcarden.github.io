                <span class="hugeLetter">T</span>he citizens of New York State have experienced dangerous, hazy air quality since March of this year. Concentrated plumes of Canadian Wildfire smoke have drifted into the atmosphere, covering several regions of the United States as a result of climate change.
            </br></br>
                Many people avoid climate change discourse because the topic is too overwhelming and abstract. For some, the trends of climate change are easy to ignore because the region they reside in is not directly impacted. For people across Central New York, the extreme weather has become impossible to ignore.
            </br></br>
                With two months remaining in the wildfire season, 2023 is already the most destructive  season on record for Canada. The month of July broke records across the globe            as the hottest July ever recorded. While this year has exhibited cruel summer temperatures and prolonged droughts, the trends of extreme weather are not new. Wildfires, for example, are the result of extreme hot and dry conditions—directly linked to climate change and global warming.

            </br></br>
                The United Nations defines <a href="https://www.un.org/en/climatechange/what-is-climate-change"> climate change </a> as, “long-term shifts in temperatures and weather patterns, mainly caused by human activities, especially the burning of fossil fuels.” Greenhouse gases caused by the burning of fossil fuels wrap around the earth, trapping heat and causing temperatures to soar. Common greenhouse gases burned in human processes include carbon dioxide and methane. 
            </br></br>
                Large wildfires can have a significant impact on the quality of air in the atmosphere. 
                Last year, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1RPm-2rr-b7CFbLlLPl4TuBtSRueLN37ETExgJQqe-6g/edit?usp=sharing"> reported  
                </a>199 days with moderate air quality and eight days with unhealthy air quality in New 
                York state. </br></br>
                Air quality index (AQI) is a standardized measurement of air pollution and associated health risks in a specific area. There are six levels of AQI, ranging from good to hazardous: </br> </br>
                <span style="color:green">
                 0-50 is considered good air quality. There are no 
                health risks.</span> </br>
                <span style="color:tan">51-100 is moderate and considered acceptable. There is little chance of health risk for sensitive populations.</span></br>
                <span style="color:orange"> 101-150 is considered unhealthy for sensitive groups. Doctors beging to advice against strenuous activity outdoors regarldess of health condition.</span></br>
                <span style="color:orangered"> 150-200 is considered unhealthy to both sensitive groups and members of the general public.</span></br>
                <span style="color:palevioletred"> 200-300 is considered very unhealthy. The risk of health affects is increased for everyone.</span></br>
                <span style="color:darkred"> Any AQI above 300 is considered hazardous. There are emergency health risks.</span>
            </br><br>

                This year, the trend of high temperatures and poor air quality have continued. Throughout the spring and summer months, the citizens of Syracuse, New York have encountered poor air quality and hazy sunsets as wildfire plumes travel west from Canada. 
                </br></br>
                The IQAir non-profit foundation <a href="https://www.iqair.com/us/usa/new-york/syracuse">
                tracked</a> daily air quality in New York from July 9 through August 9. The peak AQI occured on July 16 with an unhealthy air quality of 103.

                 From the month-long period, there were a total of 23 days with a healthy air quality between 0 and 50 and a total of seven days with moderate air quality between  51 and 100. 
                 The average AQI in Syracuse between July and August was 41. 
             </br></br>
                 The highest reported AQI occurred on July 17th, with an   AQI of 103—an air quality unhealthy for sensitive groups.
                 Poor air quality affects sensitive groups including older populations, young children and infants, people who work outdoors and people with lung conditions such as asthma and pulmonary disease. 
             </br> </br>
                According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), wildfire smoke can make <em>anyone                 
                </em> sick. Wildfire smoke is dangerous because the omitted fumes carry a mix of gasses and tiny, harmful fragments of debris participles. <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/disasters/wildfires/smoke.html"> Health affects</a> of breathing in smoke include coughing, trouble breathing, eye burning, throat irritation, headaches, shortness of breath and chest pain.
            </br> </br>
                Syracuse resident Irvin Daniels, 72, does not have any pre-existing
                health conditions. Regardless, he takes precautions on the hazy days. When the AQI is high, Daniels wears a face covering. "I take the necessary precautions to avoid the smoke," he explained.

                Syracuse native Dan Ballantyne, 60, is the owner of <a href="https://ballantynegardens.com/"> Ballantyne Gardens</a>. The employees of the landscaping company work long hours outdoors in  Central New York. According to Ballantyne, he has been forced to cut back work hours due to poor air quality. “We’ve had to wear masks, we’ve had to shorten our working hours,” he said. “It’s been frustrating as a business owner.”

                According to Canada’s Department of Natural Resources, several factors related to climate change can increase the risk of wildfires. High temperatures 
                and dry climate foster the perfect environment for wildfires like those currently burning millions of acres of forests in Canada. Damage from insects, animals and droughts can also
                dry out weakened trees, making them more susceptible to wildfire risks. </br></br>
                Climate scientists refer to these conditions as "Tinder Box" like.
                </br></br>
                Addressing climate change is a complex task. However, experts believe the extreme weather will only get <em>more extreme</em> 
                    if we ignore it. The continued progression of climate change due to human activity will 
                continue to cause more severe extreme weather events, posing health challenges for local communities here in New York State and across the world.
