                <span class="hugeLetter">T</span>he citizens of New York State have experienced dangerous, hazy air quality since March of this year. Concentrated plumes of Canadian Wildfire smoke have drifted into the atmosphere, covering several regions of the United States as a result of climate change. The Great Lakes Region specifically has experienced continued plumes of wildfire smoke since spring with a peak of unhealthy air quality in June. 
            </br></br>
                Many people avoid climate change discourse because the topic is too overwhelming and abstract. For some, the trends of climate change are easy to ignore because the region they reside in is not directly impacted. For people across Central New York, the extreme weather has become impossible to ignore. </br> </br>

                With two months remaining in the wildfire season, 2023 is already the most destructive  season on record for Canada. The month of July broke records across the globe as the hottest July ever recorded. While this year has exhibited cruel summer temperatures and prolonged droughts, the trends of extreme weather are not new. Wildfires, for example, are the result of extreme hot and dry conditions—directly linked to climate change and global warming.

            </br></br>
                The United Nations defines <a href="https://www.un.org/en/climatechange/what-is-climate-change"target="blank"> climate change </a> as, “long-term shifts in temperatures and weather patterns, mainly caused by human activities, especially the burning of fossil fuels.” Greenhouse gases caused by the burning of fossil fuels wrap around the earth, trapping heat and causing temperatures to soar. Common greenhouse gases burned in human processes include carbon dioxide and methane. 
           </br></br>
                The air quality index (AQI) is a standardized measurement of air pollution and associated health risks in a specific area. There are six levels of AQI, ranging from good to hazardous: </br> </br>

            0-50 is considered good air quality. There are no health risks. 51-100 is moderate and considered acceptable. There is little chance of health risk for sensitive populations. </br></br> 101-150 is considered unhealthy for sensitive groups. Doctors begin to advise against strenuous activity outdoors regardless of health condition. 150-200 is considered unhealthy to both sensitive groups and members of the general public. 200-300 is considered very unhealthy. The risk of health effects is increased for everyone. Any AQI above 300 is considered hazardous with emergency health risks.

                Large wildfires can have a significant impact on the quality of air in the atmosphere. 
                Last year, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1RPm-2rr-b7CFbLlLPl4TuBtSRueLN37ETExgJQqe-6g/edit?usp=sharing"target="blank"> reported

                This year, the trend of high temperatures and poor air quality has               continued. Throughout the spring and summer months, the citizens of Syracuse, New York have encountered poor air quality and hazy sunsets as wildfire plumes travel west from Canada. 
            </br></br>
                The IQ-Air nonprofit foundation <a href="https://www.iqair.com/us/usa/new-york/syracuse"target="blank">
                tracked</a> daily air quality in New York from July 9 through August 9.  
            The peak AQI occurred on July 16, with an unhealthy air quality of 103.
            </br></br>
                 Poor air quality affects several sensitive groups including older populations, young children and infants, people who work outdoors and people with lung conditions such as asthma and pulmonary disease. People carrying a pregnancy should also avoid exposure to poor air quality.

                 </br> The chart above measures the daily air quality based on the AQI scale between July 9 and August 9 of this year. The data was collected by the New York State Department of Enirvonmental Conservation (NYSDEC). </br></br> During the month-long period, there were a total of 23 days with a healthy air quality between 0 and 50 and a total of eight days with moderate air quality between  51 and 100. Earlier in the summer, Central New York had multiple days with hazardous air quality. On June 27, the air quality in Syracuse reached <a href="https://www.syracuse.com/weather/2023/06/air-quality-worsens-to-hazardous-in-central-ny-as-smoke-pours-in-from-canada-wildfires.html" target="_blank">a staggering 500 AQI.</a> The average AQI in Syracuse between July 9 and August 9, 2023, was 41 AQI.

                According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), wildfire smoke can make <em>anyone                 
                </em> sick. Wildfire smoke is dangerous because the omitted fumes carry a mix of gasses and tiny, harmful fragments of debris particles. <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/disasters/wildfires/smoke.html"target="blank"> Health affects</a> of breathing in smoke include coughing, trouble breathing, eye burning, throat irritation, headaches, shortness of breath and chest pain.

                Syracuse resident Irvin Daniels, 72, does not have any pre-existing
                health conditions. Regardless, he takes precautions on hazy days. When the AQI is high, Daniels wears a face covering. "I take the necessary precautions to avoid the smoke," he explained. Similarly, many college students across the city have been using face coverings when walking to and from class. </br></br> Back in June, the Cayuga County Health Department recommended wearing high-quality masks, such as N95 and KN95 masks, when outdoors during high AQI periods.

                Syracuse native Dan Ballantyne, 60, is the owner of <a href="https://ballantynegardens.com/" target="_blank"> Ballantyne Gardens</a>. The employees of the landscaping company work long hours outdoors in  Central New York. According to Ballantyne, he has been forced to cut back work hours due to poor air quality. “We’ve had to wear masks, we’ve had to shorten our working hours,” he said. “It’s been frustrating as a business owner.”

                <b>Wildfires in Canada</b>
                    </br>
                        Sparce wildfires are common in Canada throughout the summer months. But this summer in particular has been extremely devastating with millions of acres burned. Currently, there are over 1,000 fires burning across the country. 
                    </br></br>
                       Regions across the globe are feeling the effects of the wildfires in Canada. The wildfires have devastated stretches of forests, leading to mass evacuations. The fires continue to pose significant challenges to firefighting and containment efforts.

                       According to Canada’s Department of Natural Resources, several factors related to climate change can increase the risk of wildfires. High temperatures 
                        and dry climate foster the perfect environment for wildfires like those currently burning millions of acres of forests in Canada. Climate scientists refer to these conditions as<i> Tinder Box.</i>
                    </br></br>
                        Another factor to the disastrous wildfires is the shortage of firefighters needed to keep up with the flames. Hundreds of firefighters have traveled to Canada to help stop the spread. According to the Canadian Interagency Forest Fire Center, more than 400 firefighters have traveled from the United States. So far, other international firefighters have traveled from Australia, New Zealand, South Africa, Costa Rica, Chile, Spain, Portugal, France and Mexico.
                    </br></br>
                        “Canada is the second-largest country in the world, and almost half of that is forest," Quinn Barber, a fire science analyst at the Canadian Forest Services <a href="https://www.opb.org/article/2023/07/21/canada-wildfires-smoke-firefighting/" target="_blank">told</a> NPR. A lot of that forest is remote, untouched wilderness, and it's very difficult to manage wildfire in those areas where there is no road access or any of the infrastructure needed to support firefighting activity."

                Addressing climate change is a complex task. But experts believe the extreme weather will only get <em>more extreme</em> if we ignore it. In 2022, <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/short-reads/2022/08/12/most-americans-who-have-faced-extreme-weather-see-a-link-to-climate-change-republicans-included/" target="_blank">a study</a> by the Pew Research Institute found that 71% of Americans say their community has experienced extreme weather as a result of climate change.
            </br></br>
                The continued progression of climate change due to human activity will continue to cause severe weather events, posing health challenges for local communities here in New York State and across the world.
